# Hi there, Sujana Shahrin here ! 👋

I am a Computer Science student focused on building efficient software and exploring web technologies. I enjoy solving problems using Java, C++, and modern web tools.

### 🛠 My Tech Stack
* **Languages:** Java, C++, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA
* **Current Focus:** Strengthening my Data Structures & Algorithms and Full-stack development.

### 📁 Top Projects

* **[SDRS: Smart Disaster Response and Alert Management System](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/sujana008/SDRS)** 
  **Tech:** LoRaWAN, AWS Cloud, AI, Next.js, SMS Gateway.
  **Details:** Developed a resilient, IoT-based early warning system for flood-prone regions in Bangladesh. It uses a LoRaWAN sensor network for real-time hydrological data collection , an AI engine for hazard prediction , and AWS for scalable data processing. Alerts are disseminated through a Next.js dashboard, mobile apps, and SMS to ensure last-mile reach.

* **[MRI Brain Metastasis Detection Analysis](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/sujana008/MRI-Analysis)**  
  **Tech:** Python, Deep Learning (ResNet-50), Image Preprocessing (OpenCV).
  **Details:** Conducted a systematic study on the impact of nine neighborhood-based preprocessing filters (e.g., Box Filter, Gaussian, Laplacian) on detecting brain metastases in MRI scans. Achieved a peak classification accuracy of 84.60% using a custom-headed ResNet-50 architecture on the BCBM-RadioGenomics dataset.

* **[Bitcoin Price Prediction](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/sujana008/Bitcoin-AI)** 
  **Tech:** XGBoost, Ridge Polynomial Regression, Time-Series Analysis. 
  **Details:** A comparative machine learning study predicting daily BTC closing prices. Built a comprehensive feature engineering pipeline involving lagged differences, rolling statistics, and technical indicators (RSI, MACD). XGBoost was demonstrated to be superior in capturing nonlinear temporal dependencies in volatile financial data.




* **[OnlyGains - Full Stack Fitness Platform](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/sujana008/OnlyGains)**
  **Tech:** React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB.
  **Details:** A comprehensive full-stack application featuring user authentication, personalized workout tracking, and a robust database implementation for managing fitness progress and community data.


* **[TenantFlow - Property Management System](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/sujana008/TenantFlow)**
  **Tech:** Full-stack development, Database Management.
  **Details:** Streamlined property management platform focusing on the interaction between tenants and owners, featuring automated billing and maintenance request tracking.


* **[CareerLence - Professional Portfolio & Job Board](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/sujana008/CareerLence)**
  **Tech:** Advanced Frontend (Tailwind/CSS), JavaScript.
  **Details:** High-performance frontend implementation focused on UI/UX best practices, providing a seamless interface for career tracking and recruitment.


* **[Automated Orange Quality Assessment](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/sujana008/Orange-Quality)** 
  **Tech:** YOLOv7, Computer Vision, Predictive Analytics.
  **Details:** Proposed an AI-driven agricultural system using YOLOv7 for real-time defect detection and shelf-life estimation for oranges. The system automates quality grading to optimize supply chain efficiency and reduce waste.
